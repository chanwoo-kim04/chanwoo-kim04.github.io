Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the collection of all Borel sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with the property that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exist a compact set $K$ and an open set $U$ satisfying $K \subseteq A \subseteq U$ and $\mu \qty(U-K) < \varepsilon$. 
We will show that $\mathcal{D}$ is equal to the entire Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B} \qty(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which will prove that the finite measure $\mu$ is regular. 

First, we prove that $\mathcal{D}$ is a d-system. 
The set $\mathbb{R}^d$ belongs to $\mathcal{D}$ because, as $\mu$ is a finite measure, $\mathbb{R}^d$ is the increasing union of compact balls $K_n$, and by the continuity of measure, $\lim_n \mu \qty(\mathbb{R}^d - K_n) = 0$. 
For any $\varepsilon > 0$, we can choose $n$ large enough that $\mu \qty(\mathbb{R}^d - K_n ) < \varepsilon$, and the choice of $K = K_n$ and $U = \mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies the condition.
To show closure under proper differences, let $A$, $B \in \mathcal{D}$ with $B \subseteq A$. 
For any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose compact sets $K_A$, $K_B$ and open sets $U_A$, $U_B$ such that $K_A \subseteq A \subseteq U_A$ with $\mu \qty(U_A-K_A) < \varepsilon / 2$, and $K_B \subseteq B \subseteq U_B$ with $\mu \qty(U_B - K_B) < \varepsilon / 2$. 
Let $K = K_A - U_B$ and $U = U_A - K_B$.
Then $K$ is a compact set contained in $A-B$, and $U$ is an open set containing $A-B$. 
The difference $U-K$ is a subset of $\qty(U_A - K_A) \cup \qty(U_B - K_B)$. 
Thus, $\mu \qty(U-K) \leq \mu \qty(U_A - K_A) + \mu \qty(U_B - K_B) < \varepsilon$, so $A-B \in \mathcal{D}$. 
To prove closure under countable increasing unions, let $\qty{A_n}$ be an increasing sequence in $\mathcal{D}$ with union $A = \bigcup_n A_n$. 
Let $\varepsilon > 0$. 
For each $n$, because $A_n \in \mathcal{D}$, we can choose an open set $U_n \supseteq A_n$ such that $\mu \qty(U_n - A_n) < \varepsilon / 2^{n+1}$. 
Let $U = \bigcup_n U_n$. 
Then $U$ is an open set containing $A$. 
The difference $U-A$ is a subset of $\bigcup_n \qty(U_n - A_n)$, so by subadditivity, $\mu \qty(U-A) \leq \sum_n \mu \qty(U_n - A_n) < \varepsilon / 2$. 
This establishes the required outer approximation. 
For the inner approximation, note that $\mu \qty(A) = \lim_n \mu \qty(A_n)$, which means we can choose an integer $N$ such that $\mu\qty(A-A_N) < \varespilon / 4$. 
As $A_N \in \mathcal{D}$, there exists a compact set $K \subseteq A_N$ with $\mu \qty(A_N - K) < \varepsilon / 4$. 
This set $K$ is a compact subset of $A$, and $\mu \qty(A-K) = \mu \qty(A-A_N) + \mu \qty(A_N - K) < \varepsilon / 2$. 
For the chosen open set $U$ and compact set $K$, we have $K \subseteq A \subseteq U$ and $\mu \qty(U-K) = \mu \qty(U-A) + \mu \qty(A-K) < \varepsilon$. 
Thus, $A \in \mathcal{D}$. 
Since all three conditions are met, $\mathcal{D}$ is a d-system. 

Next, we show that $\mathcal{D}$ contains a generating $\pi$-system for $\mathcal{B} \qty(\mathbb{R}^d)$. 
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of all open rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^d$. 
This is a $\pi$-system that generates $\mathcal{B} \qty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ by *Proposition 1.1.5*. 
For any open rectangle $R \in \mathcal{C}$, we can find an increasing sequence of compact rectangles $\qty{K_n}$ that are contained in $R$ and whose union is $R$. 
By continuity of measure, $\mu \qty(R) = \lim_n \mu \qty(K_n)$. 
For any $\varepsilon > 0$, we can choose $n$ large enough such that $\mu \qty(R-K_n) < \varepsilon$. 
Taking $K = K_n$ and $U = R$, we have $K \subseteq R \subseteq U$ and $\mu \qty(U-K) < \varepsilon$, which shows that $R \in \mathcal{D}$. 
Thus, $\mathcal{C} \in \mathcal{D}$. 

Since $\mathcal{D}$ is a d-system that contains the generating $\pi$-system $\mathcal{C}$, it follows from *Theorem 1.6.2* that $\mathcal{D}$ contains the entire $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$. 
That is, $\mathcal{B}\qty(\mathbb{R}^d) \subseteq \mathcal{D}$. 
This means every Borel set has the approximation property that defines $\mathcal{D}$. 
This property implies both outer regularity and inner regularity with respect to compact sets for all Borel sets, which proves that the finite measure $\mu$ is regular.
