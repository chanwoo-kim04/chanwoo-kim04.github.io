(a) Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of subsets of $X$. 
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of all monotone classes on $X$ that contain $\mathcal{A}$. 
This family is nonempty because the power set $\mathcal{P} \qty(X)$ is a monotone class containing $\mathcal{A}$. 
We define the monotone class generated by $\mathcal{A}$, denoted $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$, as the intersection of all monotone classes in $\mathcal{F}$:

$$
  m \qty(\mathcal{A}) = \bigcap_{\mathcal{C} \in \mathcal{F}} \mathcal{C}
$$

By construction, $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ contains $\mathcal{A}$ and is contained in every monotone class that includes $\mathcal{A}$. 
We must show that $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is itself a monotone class. 

Let $\qty{A_n}$ be an increasing sequence of sets in $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 
By the definition of an intersection, for any monotone class $\mathcal{C} \in \mathcal{F}$, the sequence $\qty{A_n}$ is in $\mathcal{C}$. 
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is a monotone class, the union $\bigcup_n A_n$ must also belong to $\mathcal{C}$. 
Because this holds for every $\mathcal{C} \in \mathcal{F}$, the union $\bigcup_n A_n$ must belong to their intersection, $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 
An identical argument holds for decreasing sequenceS and their intersections. 
Thus, $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is closed under monotone limits and is therefore a monotone class. 
It is the smallest such class containing $\mathcal{A}$. 

(b) We want to prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra of subsets of $X$, then $m \qty(\mathcal{A}) = \sigma \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 

First, every $\sigma$-algebra is also a monotone class, as it is closed under all countable unions and intersections, including monotone ones. 
Since $\sigma \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is a monotone class that contains $\mathcal{A}$, and $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is the smallest such class, we must have $m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \sigma \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 

For the reverse inclusion, we show that $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. 
If we can show this, then since $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ contains the algebra $\mathcal{A}$, it must also contain the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{A}$, which is $\sigma \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 
This would give $\sigma \qty(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq m \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 

To prove that $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, we first show it is an algebra. 

1. Closure under Complements:
    Let $\mathcal{D} = \qty{B \in m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \colon B^c \in m \qty(\mathcal{A})}$. 
    Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra, $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{D}$. 
    If we show $\mathcal{D}$ is a monotone class, it will follow that $m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}$, proving $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is closed under complements. 
    Let $\qty{B_n}$ be an increasing sequence in $\mathcal{D}$. 
    Then $B = \bigcup_n B_n$ is in $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 
    The sequence $\qty{B_n^c}$ is a decreasing sequence of sets in $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$, so their intersection $B^c = \bigcap_n B_n^c$ is also in $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 
    Thus, $B \in \mathcal{D}$. 
    An identical argument holds for decreasing sequences, so $\mathcal{D}$ is a monotone class. 
2. Closure under Finite Unions:
    For any fixed set $E \in \mathcal{A}$, define $\mathcal{D}_E = \qty{F \in m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \colonE \cup F \in m \qty(\mathcal{A})}$.
    Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra, $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{D}_E$.
    One can verify that $\mathcal{D}_E$ is a monotone class, which implies $m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}_E$.
    This means $E \cup F \in m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ for any $E \in \mathcal{A}$ and $F \in m \qty(\mathcal{A})$.
    Now, for a fixed $F \in m \qty(\mathcal{A})$, define $D_F = \qty{E \in m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \colon E \cup F \in m \qty(\mathcal{A})}$.
    From the previous step, we know $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{D}_F$.
    As $\mathcal{D}_F$ is also a monotone class, it follows that $m \qty(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathcal{D}_F$, proving that $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is closed under finite unions.

Since $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra, $X \in \mathcal{A} \subseteq m \qty(\mathcal{A})$. 
We have now shown that $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ contains $X$ and is closed under complements and finite unions, so it is an algebra. 

Finally, it follows from *Proposition 1.1.7(a)* that an algebra that is closed under countable increasing unions is a $\sigma$-algebra. 
By its definition as a monotone class, $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is closed under countable increasing unions. 
Therefore, $m \qty(\mathcal{A})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.
