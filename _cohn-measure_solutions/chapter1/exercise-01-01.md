### Solution

Let $\mathcal{C} = \qty{\qty{x} \colon x \in \mathbb{R}}$ be the collection of all one-point subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, and let $\mathcal{A} = \sigma \qty(\mathcal{C})$ be the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{S}$. 
We will show that $\mathcal{A}$ is precisely the collection $\mathcal{S}$ of all subsets of $\mathbb{r}$ that are either countable or have a countable complement. 

First, we observe that $\mathcal{S}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, as stated in *Example 1.1.1(f)*. 
We now prove that $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{S}$ by showing mutual inclusion.

1. $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{S}$.

  Any set $\qty{x} \in \mathcal{C}$ is finite and thus countable, which means $\qty{x} \in \mathcal{S}$. 
  Since the generating collection $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{S}$, the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{C}$, which is $\mathcal{A}$, must also be a subset of $\mathcal{S}$.

2. $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{A}$.

  Let $A$ be an arbitrary set in $\mathcal{S}$. We must consider two cases.
    - If $A$ is countable, it is a countable union of its elements, $A = \bigcup_{x \in A} \qty{x}$.
      Each singleton $\qty{x}$ is $\mathcal{C}$, so $\qty{x} \in \mathcal{A}$.
      Because $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under countable unions, and therefore $A \in \mathcal{A}$.
    - If $A$ has a countable complement, $A^c$, then by the argument above, $A^c \in \mathcal{A}$.
      Since $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under complementation, so $A = \qty(A^c)^c$ must also be in $\mathcal{A}$.
  
  In both cases, any set $\mathcal{S}$ is also in $\mathcal{A}$. 

Since both inclusions hold, we conclude that wto collections are identical.
