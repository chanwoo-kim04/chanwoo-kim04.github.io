Let the functions $f$, $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f \qty(x) = \chi_{\mathbb{Q}} \qty(x)$ and $g \qty(x) = 1$. 
Both functions are Borel measurable, as the constant function $g$ is continuous and the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, is a Borel set. 
The set of points where the functions agree is $\qty{x \colon f \qty(x) = g \qty(x)} = \mathbb{Q}$, which is a dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$. 
Furthermore, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable set, its Lebesgue measure is zero. 
This means that $f \qty(x) \neq g \qty(x)$ for almost every $x \in \mathbb{R}$. 
Thus, the functions $f$ and $g$ satisfy all the required conditions.
