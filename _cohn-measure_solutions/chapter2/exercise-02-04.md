Let $\mu$ be the Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the Cantor function, as described in *Exercise 2.1.7*. 
We know that the total measure is $\mu\qty(\mathbb{R}) = 1$ and that the measure is concentrated on the Cantor set $K$, so $\mu \qty(K) = 1$ and $\mu \qty(K^c) = 0$. 

First, we prove that if two continuous functions $f$ and $g$ agree on $K$, then they agree $\mu$-almost everywhere. 
Let $D = \qty{x \in \mathbb{R} \colon f \qty(x) \neq g \qty(x)}$. 
Our assumption states that if $x \in K$, then $f \qty(x) = g \qty(x)$, which means no point of $K$ can be in $D$. 
Therefore, $D \subseteq K^c$. 
Since $K$ is a closed set, its complement $K^c$ is a Borel set. 
As $\mu \qty(K^c) = 0$, and $D$ is a subset of this null set, $D$ is a $\mu$-negligible set. 
Thus, $f$ and $g$ agree $\mu$-almost everywhere. 

Conversely, we prove that if $f$ and $g$ agree $\mu$-almost everywhere, then they agree on all points in $K$. 
By definition, the set $D = \qty{x \in \mathbb{R} \colon f \qty(x) \neq g \qty(x)}$ is $\mu$-negligible, meaning there exists a Borel set $N$ such that $D \subseteq N$ and $\mu \qty(N) = 0$. 
We will prove the claim by contradiction. 
Assume there is a point $x_0 \in K$ such that $f \qty(x_0) \neq g \qty(x_0)$. 
This means $x_0 \in D$. 
Let $h \qty(x) = f \qty(x) - g \qty(x)$. 
Since $f$ and $g$ are continuous, $h$ is also continuous. 
The set $D$ is the preimage of the open set $\mathbb{R} - \qty{0}$ under $h$, so $D$ is a nonempty open set. 

Because $D$ is a nonempty open set containing the point $x_0 \in K$, it must have a positive $\mu$-measure. 
To see this, note that $D$ must contain an open interval $\qty(a, b)$ around $x_0$. 
By the definition of the Cantor set, this interval contains at least two points of $K$, say $p < q$. 
The measure $\mu$ is generated by the Cantor function $F$, which is strictly increasing on $K$, so $F \qty(p) < F \qty(q)$. 
This implies $\mu \qty(D) \geq \mu \qty(\left( p, q \right]) = F \qty(q) - F \qty(p) > 0$. 

By the monotonicity of measure, since $D \subseteq N$, we have the inequality $0 < \mu \qty(D) \leq \mu \qty(N)$. 
This contradicts the fact that $\mu \qty(N) = 0$. 
Therefore, the assumption that there exists a point in $K$ where $f$ and $g$ differ must be false. 
We conclude that $f \qty(x) = g \qty(x)$ for all $x \in K$.
