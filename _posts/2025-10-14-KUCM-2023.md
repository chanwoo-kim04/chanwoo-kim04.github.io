**Problem 1.**
In the polar coordinate system, find the area of the region that satisfies the inequality:

$$
  2 - 2 \cos \theta \leq r \leq 1
$$

**Solution Strategy:**
The core strategy is to use the standard integral formula for the area of a region enclosed between two polar curves, which is $A = \frac{1}{2} \int_\alpha^\beta \qty(r_{outer}^2 - r_{inner}^2) d\theta$. 
This requires first identifying the two curves, and then finding their points of intersection to establish the angular limits of integration, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Identify Boundaries and Find Intersection Points:*
    The region is bounded by the circle $r = 1$ and the cardioid $r = 2 - 2 \cos \theta$.
    We find their intersection poitns by setting the radii equal:
    
    $$
      2 - 2 \cos \theta = 1 \iff \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}
    $$
    
    This gives the intersection angles $\theta = -\pi/3$ and $\theta = \pi/3$. 
    The inequality $2 - 2 \cos \theta \leq r \leq 1$ is valid for the angular interval $\qty[-\pi/3, \pi/3]$, where $r = 1$ serves as the outer boundary and $r = 2 - 2 \cos \theta$ is the inner boundary. 

2. *Evaluate the Area:*
    Using the formula for the area between two polar curves, we set up the integral with the identified boundaries and limits:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      A &= \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty[1^2 - \qty(2 - 2 \cos \theta)^2] d \theta \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty(-3 + 8 \cos \theta - 4 \cos^2 \theta) d\theta
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Using the power-reducing identity $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \qty(1 + \cos \qty(2\theta))$:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      A &= \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty(-3 + 8 \cos \theta - 4 \frac{1 + \cos \qty(2 \theta)}{2}) d\theta \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty(-5 + 8 \cos \theta - 2 \cos \qty(2\theta)) d\theta \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}\qty[-5\theta + 8\sin \theta - \sin \qty(2\theta)]_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} = \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{5\pi}{3}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

**Problem 2.**
Let $V$ be the vector space of $2 \times 2$ real matrices as follows:

$$
  V = \qty{\mqty(a & b \\ c & d) \colon a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}}
$$

When the linear map $T \colon V \to V$ is defined as $T \qty(A) = A^{\top}$, find all eigenvalues of $T$ and the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.
(Note: $A^{\top}$ is the transpose of $A$).

**Solution Strategy:**
The strategy is to first constrain the possible values for the eigenvalues. 
By observing that applying the transpose operator twice returns the origianl matrix, we can deduce that any eigenvalue $\lambda$ must satisfy the equation $\lambda^2 = 1$. 
This simplifies the problem by limiting the possible eigenvalues to $1$ and $-1$. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Find the Possible Eigenvalues:*
    Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $T$ with a corresponding nonzero eigenvector $A$.
    By definition, this means $T \qty(A) = \lambda A$.
    We can apply the operator $T$ a second time to this equation:
    
    $$
      T \qty(T \qty(A)) = T \qty(\lambda A) = \lambda T \qty(A) = \lambda^2 A
    $$
    
    However, we also know that the transpose of a transpose is the original matrix. 
    Therefore, for any $A \in V$, we have $T \qty(T \qty(A)) = A$. 
    Equating the two expressions for $T \qty(T \qty(A))$ gives $\lambda^2 A = A$, so we can conclude that $\lambda^2 = 1$. 
    The only possible real eigenvalues are therefore $\lambda = 1$ and $\lambda = -1$. 

2. *Determine the Eigenspace for $\lambda = 1$:*
    We seek all nonzero matrix $A$ that satisfy the eigenvector equation for $\lambda = 1$:
    
    $$
      T \qty(A) = A \implies A^{\top} = A
    $$
    
    This is the definition of a symmetric matrix. 
    The set of all $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrices from a subspace of $V$. 
    Any nonzero matrix in this subspace is an eigenvector. 
    A general symmetric matrix has the form:
    
    $$
      A = \mqty(a & c \\ c & d)
    $$

    Thus, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$ are all nonzero $2 \times 2$ symmetric matrices. 

3. *Determine the Eigenspace for $\lambda = -1$:*
    Next, we seek all nonzero matrices $A$ that satisfy the eigenvector equation for $\lambda = -1$:
    
    $$
      T \qty(A) = -A \implies A^{\top} = -A
    $$
    
    This is the definition of a skew-symmetric matrix. 
    The set of all $2 \times 2$ skew-symmetric matrices forms another subspace of $V$. 
    A general $2 \times 2$ skew-symmetric matrix has the form:
    
    $$
      A = \mqty(0 & b \\ -b & 0)
    $$
    
    Thus, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda = -1$ are all nonzero $2 \times 2$ skew-symmetric matrices. 

**Problem 3.**
The position of a moving point $X$ on the coordinate plane at time $t$ is represented by the following parametric function:

$$
  X \qty(t) = 3 \qty(\cos t, \sin t) + \qty( \cos 15 t, \sin 15 t), \quad t \in \qty[0, \frac{\pi}{6}]
$$

Find the range of time $t$ during which the angle of point $X$, relative to the origin, changes in the clockwise direction. 

**Solution Strategy:**
The direction of angular motion is determined by the sing of the angular velocity, $\dv{\theta}{t}$. 
The strategy is to first determine the angle $\theta$ of the point in terms of its Cartesian coordinates, $\qty(x \qty(t), y \qty(t))$, and then find an expression for its time derivative, $\theta' \qty(t)$. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Express the Angle and Its Derivative:*
    The position of the point is given by $X \qty(t) = \qty(x \qty(t), y \qty(t))$, where $x \qty(t) = 3 \cos t + \cos 15t$ and $y \qty(t) = 3 \sin t + \sin 15t$.
    The angle $\theta$ satisfies $\tan\theta = y/x$.
    Differentiating implicitly with respect to $t$ gives the angular velocity:
    
    $$
      \theta' \qty(t) = \frac{x \qty(t) y' \qty(t) - y \qty(t) x' \qty(t)}{x\qty(t)^2 + y \qty(t)^2}
    $$
    
    The motion is clockwise when $\theta' \qty(t) < 0$. 
    Since the denominator $x \qty(t)^2 + y \qty(t)^2$ is always nonnegative, the condition for clockwise motion simplifies to the numerator being negative:
    
    $$
      x \qty(t) y' \qty(t) - y \qty(t) x' \qty(t) < 0
    $$

2. *Calculate the Numerator:*
    First, we find the derivatives of the components:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      x' \qty(t) &= -3\sin t - 15 \sin 15 t \\
      y' \qty(t) &= 3 \cos t + 15 \cos 15 t
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Next, we substitute these into the numerator expression:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      N \qty(t) &= x \qty(t) y' \qty(t) - y \qty(t) x' \qty(t) \\
      &= \qty(3 \cos t + 15 \cos t) \qty(3 \cos t + 15 \cos 15 t) - \qty(3 \sin t + \sin 15 t) \qty(-3 \sin t - 15 \sin 15 t) \\
      &= 9 \qty(\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t) + 15 \qty(\cos^2 15 t + \sin^2 15 t) + 48 \qty(\cos t \cos 15 t + \sin t \sin 15 t)
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Using the identities $\cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1$ and $\cos \qty(A-B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B$, we simplify the expression:
    
    $$
      N \qty(t) = 24 + 48 \cos \qty(14t)
    $$

3. *Solve the Trigonometric Inequality:*
    We set the numerator to be less than zero to find the interval of clockwise motion:
    
    $$
      24 + 48 \cos \qty(14t) < 0 \iff \cos \qty(14t) < -\frac{1}{2}
    $$
    
    Therefore, the angle of point $X$ changes in the clockwise direction for $t \in \qty(\frac{\pi}{21}, \frac{2\pi}{21})$. 

**Problem 4.**
Let the set $S$ be defined as $S = \qty{2^k \colon \text{$k$ is a non-negative integer}}$, i.e., $S = \qty{1, 2, 4, 8, \dots}$. 
We want to express a positive integer $n$ as a sum of elements from $S$, with the condition that the same number can be used at most three times. 
Let $f \qty(n)$ be the number of ways to do this. 
For example, for $n = 7$, there are four ways, so $f \qty(7) = 4$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  7 &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 \\
  &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 \\
  &= 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 \\
  &= 1 + 2 + 4
\end{aligned}
$$

Express $f \qty(n)$ as a formula in terms of $n$. 

**Solution Strategy:**
The structure involving integer partitions with restricted parts (powers of two) and frequencies (at most three uses) strongly suggests that a generating function could be a powerful tool. An initial plan would be to construct this function, where each allowed part contributes a polynomial factor corresponding to its permitted frequencies. This will naturally lead to an infinite product. The main challenge would then be to algebraically simplify this infinite product. The hope is that its structure allows for cancellation or transformation into a recognizable, simpler function. If a closed form can be found, the final step would be to interpret its series expansion to find a general formula for the coefficients, which represent the number of partitions for any given $n$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Construct the Generating Function:*
    For each part $2^k \in S$, we can use it $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ times.
    This choice is represented by the polynomial factor $\qty(1 + x^{2^k} +  \qty(x^{2^k})^2 + \qty(x^{2^k})^3)$.
    The generating fucntino $G \qty(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f\qty(n)x^n$ is the infinite product of these factors for $k = 0$, $1$, $2$, $\dots$:
    
    $$
      G \qty(x) = \prod_{k=0}^\infty \qty(1 + x^{2^k} +  \qty(x^{2^k})^2 + \qty(x^{2^k})^3)
    $$

2. *Simplify the Generating Function:*
    Each factor can be simplified using the identity $1 + y + y^2 + y^3 = \frac{1 - y^4}{1 - y}$.
    Applying this to our product gives:
    
    $$
      G \qty(x) = \prod_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1 - \qty(x^{2^k})^4}{1 - x^{2^k}} = \prod_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1 - x^{2^{k+2}}}{1 - x^{2^k}}
    $$
    
    This is a telescoping product. After canceling the common terms, we are left with a simple expression:
    
    $$
      G \qty(x) = \frac{1}{\qty(1 - x) \qty(1-x^2)}
    $$

3. *Interpret the Simplified Function:*
    The simplified generating function $G \qty(x)$ is the product of two well-known series:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      G \qty(x) &= \qty(\frac{1}{1-x})\qty(\frac{1}{1-x^2}) \\
      &= \qty(\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i)\qty(\sum_{j=0}^\infty x^{2j})
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Therefore, $f \qty(n)$, the coefficient of $x^n$, is the number of nonnegative integer solution to the equation $n = 1 \cdot i + 2 \cdot j$. 

4. *Derive the Closed-form Expression for $f \qty(n)$:*
    For any choice of $j$, the value of $i$ is uniquely determined as $i = n - 2j$.
    The constraint that $i \geq 0$ implies:
    
    $$
      n - 2j \geq 0 \implies j \leq \frac{n}{2}
    $$
    
    Since $j$ must be a nonnegative integer, the possible values for $j$ are $0$, $1$, $2$, \dots, $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. 
    Thus, the final expression for $f \qty(n)$ is:
    
    $$
      f \qty(n) = 1 + \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor
    $$

**Problem 5.**
(1) For $n \times n$ real matrices $A$ and $B$, prove that any eigenvalue of the matrix $AB$ is also an eigenvalue of the matrix $BA$. 

(2) For an odd positive integer $n$, let $A$ and $B$ be $n \times n$ real matrices that satisfy the equation:

$$
  2AB = \qty(BA)^2 + I_n
$$

Show that $\det \qty(I_n - AB) = 0$. (Note: $I_n$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix). 

**Solution Strategy:**
For the first part, the standard approach is to start with the definition of an eigenvalue for $AB$ and left-multiply by $B$, which should transform the equation to reveal an eigenvalue for $BA$. A special case for a zero eigenvalue might need separate consideration. For the second part, the goal of showing $\det\qty(I−AB) = 0$ is equivalent to proving that $1$ is an eigenvalue of $AB$. The given equation and the condition that $n$ is odd are the key tools. The odd dimensionality guarantees the existence of at least one real eigenvalue for $BA$. A plausible strategy is to take this real eigenvalue, $\lambda$, and its eigenvector and apply the given matrix equation to it. This will likely create a new expression that must also correspond to an eigenvalue of $BA$. By analyzing the relationship between the original eigenvalue $\lambda$ and this new one, we might be able to find the exact value of $\lambda$, which would hopefully lead to the desired conclusion.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
(1) 
1. *Handle the General Case:*
    Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $AB$ with a corresponding eigenvector $v$, such that $ABv = \lambda v$. 
    Left-multiplying by $B$ gives:
    
    $$
      B \qty(ABv) = B \qty(\lambda v) \implies \qty(BA)\qty(Bv) = \lambda \qty(Bv)
    $$
    
    This equation shows that if the vector $Bv$ is nonzero, then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $BA$ with eigenvector $Bv$. 

2. *Handle the Special Case $Bv = 0$:*
    If $Bv = 0$, then the original eigenvalue equation becomes $ABv = A \qty(Bv) = 0$.
    This means $\lambda v = 0$.
    Since $v$ is nonzero, we must have $\lambda = 0$.
    So, if $Bv = 0$, the eigenvalue of $AB$ must be $0$.
    If $\lambda = 0$ is an eigenvalue of $AB$, then $AB$ is singular, which implies that $BA$ is also singular and must have an eigenvalue of $0$.
    Thus, in all cases, any eigenvalue of $AB$ is also an eigenvalue of $BA$.

(2)
1. *Establish the Existence of a Real Eigenvalue:*
    Since $BA$ is an $n \times n$ real matrix and $n$ is odd, its characteristic polynomial is a real polynomial of odd degree.
    Such a polynomial must have at least one real root.
    Therefore, $BA$ is guaranteed to have at least one real eigenvalue.
    Let $\lambda$ be the largest real eigenvalue of $BA$, and let $v$ eb a corresponding eigenvector such that $BAv = \lambda v$.

2. *Find a New Eigenvalue from the Given Equation:*
    We apply the given equation $2AB = \qty(BA)^2 + I$ to the eigenvector $v$:
    
    $$
      2ABv = \qty(\qty(BA)^2 + I) \lambda = \qty(\lambda^2 + 1) v
    $$
    
    This implies $\qty(AB)v = \frac{1}{2} \qty(\lambda^2 + 1)v$. 
    This shows that $\mu = \frac{1}{2} \qty(\lambda^2 + 1)$ is an eigenvalue of $AB$. 

3. *Constrain the VAlue of the Eigenvalue:*
    From part (1), we know that if $\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $AB$, it must also be an eigenvalue of $BA$.
    Since $\lambda$ is real, $\mu$ is also real.
    By our initial assumption, $\lambda$ is the largest real eigenvalue of $BA$.
    Therefore, we must have $\mu \leq \lambda$:
    
    $$
      \frac{1}{2}\qty(\lambda^2 + 1) \leq \lambda
    $$
    
    which is equivalent to $\qty(\lambda - 1)^2 \leq 0$. 
    Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, the only possibility is $\lambda = 1$. 

4. *Conclusion:*
    We have shown that $1$ is an eigenvalue of $BA$. 
    By the result from part (1), $1$ must also be an eigenvalue of $AB$. 
    This implies that the matrix $I - AB$ is singular, meaning $\det \qty(I - AB) = 0$. 

**Problem 6.**
Let $S$ be the subset of positive integers defined as $S = \qty{k \colon 1 \leq k \leq 2023, \text{ $k$ and $2023$ are relatively prime}}$. 
Let $N$ be defined as follows:

$$
  N = \sum_{a \in S}\sum_{b \in S} \qty{\frac{ab}{2023}}
$$

Show that $N$ is a positive integer and find its prime factorization. 
(Note: For al real number $t$, $\qty{t} = t - \lfloor t \rfloor$, where $\lfloor t \rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $t$). 

**Solution Strategy:**
This problem presents a double summation over a set $S$ defined by a coprimality condition, which is a hallmark of number theory problems involving modular arithmetic. The strategy is to simplify the sum by exploiting the algebraic structure of $S$. The set $S$ represents the group of units modulo $2023$, $\qty(\mathbb{Z}/2023\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$. The key insight is to fix the outer variable $a$ and analyze the inner summation over $b$. Since $a$ is an element of this group, multiplication by a simply permutes the elements of the group. This means the set of products is identical to the set $S$ itself. This powerful symmetry implies that the value of the inner sum is constant, regardless of the choice of $a$. This reduces the double summation to a much simpler expression involving the size of $S$ and the sum of its elements.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Analyze the Structure of the Summation and Set $S$:*
    The set $S$ consists of all integer $k$ from $1$ to $2023$ that are coprime to $2023$.
    This set forms the group of units modulo $2023$.
    The size of this set is given by Euler's totient function, $\abs{S} = \varphi \qty(2023) = 1632$.
    The fractional part in the sum can be written using the modulo operator: $\qty{\frac{ab}{2023}} = \frac{ab \mod 2023}{2023}$

2. *Simplify the Inner Sum Using Modular Arithmetic:*
    Let's fix an element $a \in S$ and consider the inner sum $C_a = \sum_{b \in S} \qty{\frac{ab}{2023}}$.
    Since $a$ is coprime to $2023$, the function $f \qty(b) = ab \mod 2023$ is a permutation of the set $S$.
    Therefore, the set of values $\qty{ab \mod 2023 \colon b \in S}$ is the same as the set $S$.
    This means the inner sum is constant for any choice of $a$:
    
    $$
      C_a = \sum_{b \in S} \frac{ab \mod 2023}{2023} = \sum_{c \in S} \frac{c}{2023}
    $$

3. *Calculate the Sum of Elements in $S$:*
    To find the sum $\sum_{c \in S}c$, we use a pairing argument.
    If an integer $c$ is coprime to $2023$, then so is $2023-c$.
    Thus, if $c \in S$, then $2023 - c \in S$.
    We can group the elements of $S$ into pairs $\qty(c, 2023 - c)$, where each pair sums to $2023$.
    No element is its own pair, since $c = 2023 - c$ has no integer solution.
    The number of such pairs is exactly half of the number of elements in $S$.
    Therefore, the sum of all elements in $S$ is the sum of each pair multiplied by the number of pairs:
    
    $$
      \sum_{c \in S}c = \frac{1}{2} \varphi \qty(2023) \cdot 2023
    $$

4. *Calculate the Final Value:*
    The total sum $N$ becomes:
    
    $$
      N = \sum_{a \in S}C_a = \varphi \qty(2023) \sum_{c \in S}\frac{c}{2023} = \frac{1}{2}\varphi \qty(2023)^2
    $$
    
    Now, we find the prime factorization of $\varphi \qty(2023) = 1632 = 2^5 \cdot 3 \cdot 17$.
    
    $$
      N = 2^9 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 17^2
    $$

**Problem 7.**
A sequence $\qty{a_n}$ satisfies the following equation:

$$
  \sqrt[4]{\frac{1 + 4x}{1 - 4x}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n, \quad \abs{x} < \frac{1}{4}
$$

Show that for all $n \geq 0$, $a_n$ is a non-negative integer.

- If $A$ rolls a number that is a multiple of $4$, $A$ moves up $4$ steps.
- If $B$ rolls a number that is a multiple of $6$, $B$ moves up $6$ steps.
- In all other cases, the player does not move.

If $A$ rolls the die first, what is the probability that $A$ will win? (Assume they continue rolling alternately until one person wins).

**Problem 7.** 
A sequence $\qty{a_n}$ satisfies the following equation:

$$
  \sqrt[4]{\frac{1 + 4x}{1 - 4x}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n, \quad \abs{x} < \frac{1}{4}
$$

Show that for all $n \geq 0$, $a_n$ is a non-negative integer.
