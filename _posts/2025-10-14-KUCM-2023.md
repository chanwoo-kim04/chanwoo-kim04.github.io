**Problem 1.**
In the polar coordinate system, find the area of the region that satisfies the inequality:

$$
  2 - 2 \cos \theta \leq r \leq 1
$$

**Solution Strategy:**
The core strategy is to use the standard integral formula for the area of a region enclosed between two polar curves, which is $A = \frac{1}{2} \int_\alpha^\beta \qty(r_{outer}^2 - r_{inner}^2) d\theta$. 
This requires first identifying the two curves, and then finding their points of intersection to establish the angular limits of integration, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Identify Boundaries and Find Intersection Points:*
    The region is bounded by the circle $r = 1$ and the cardioid $r = 2 - 2 \cos \theta$.
    We find their intersection poitns by setting the radii equal:
    
    $$
      2 - 2 \cos \theta = 1 \iff \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}
    $$
    
    This gives the intersection angles $\theta = -\pi/3$ and $\theta = \pi/3$. 
    The inequality $2 - 2 \cos \theta \leq r \leq 1$ is valid for the angular interval $\qty[-\pi/3, \pi/3]$, where $r = 1$ serves as the outer boundary and $r = 2 - 2 \cos \theta$ is the inner boundary. 

2. *Evaluate the Area:*
Using the formula for the area between two polar curves, we set up the integral with the identified boundaries and limits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  A &= \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty[1^2 - \qty(2 - 2 \cos \theta)^2] d \theta \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty(-3 + 8 \cos \theta - 4 \cos^2 \theta) d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the power-reducing identity $\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \qty(1 + \cos \qty(2\theta))$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  A &= \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty(-3 + 8 \cos \theta - 4 \frac{1 + \cos \qty(2 \theta)}{2}) d\theta \\
  &= \frac{1}{2}\int_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} \qty(-5 + 8 \cos \theta - 2 \cos \qty(2\theta)) d\theta \\
  &= \frac{1}{2}\qty[-5\theta + 8\sin \theta - \sin \qty(2\theta)]_{-\pi/3}^{\pi/3} = \frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{5\pi}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Problem 2.**
Let $V$ be the vector space of $2 \times 2$ real matrices as follows:

$$
  V = \qty{\mqty(a & b \\ c & d) \colon a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}}
$$

When the linear map $T \colon V \to V$ is defined as $T \qty(A) = A^{\top}$, find all eigenvalues of $T$ and the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.
(Note: $A^{\top}$ is the transpose of $A$).

**Problem 3.**
The position of a moving point $X$ on the coordinate plane at time $t$ is represented by the following parametric function:

$$
  X \qty(t) = 3 \qty(\cos t, \sin t) + \qty( \cos 15 t, \sin 15 t), \quad t \in \qty[0, \frac{\pi}{6}]
$$

**Problem 4.**
Let the set $S$ be defined as $S = \qty{2^k \colon \text{$k$ is a non-negative integer}}$, i.e., $S = \qty{1, 2, 4, 8, \dots}$. 
We want to express a positive integer $n$ as a sum of elements from $S$, with the condition that the same number can be used at most three times. 
Let $f \qty(n)$ be the number of ways to do this. 
For example, for $n = 7$, there are four ways, so $f \qty(7) = 4$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  7 &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 \\
  &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 \\
  &= 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 \\
  &= 1 + 2 + 4
\end{aligned}
$$

Express $f \qty(n)$ as a formula in terms of $n$.

Let $N$ be defined as follows:

$$
  N = \sum_{a \in S}\sum_{b \in S} \qty{\frac{ab}{2023}}
$$

Show that $N$ is a positive integer and find its prime factorization.
