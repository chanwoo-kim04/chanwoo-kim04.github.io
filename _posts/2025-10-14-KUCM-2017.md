**Problem 6.**
For a positive integer $n$, an $n \times n$ real matrix $A$ satisfies the following conditions with $J$, the $n \times n$ matrix of all ones:

$$
  A + A^{\top} = \frac{1}{n}J, \quad AJ = \frac{1}{2}J
$$

Show that for every positive odd integer $m$, the matrix $A^m - I$ is invertible. (Here, $A^{\top}$ is the transpose of $A$.)

**Solution:**
To show that the matrix $A^m - I$ is invertible for any positive odd integer $m$, we will prove that $1$ cannot be an eigenvalue of $A^m$. 
Our approach is to decompose the matrix $A$ into its symmetric and antisymmetric components and then use the given conditions to constrain the behavior of any potentical eigenvector $v$. 

Any square matrix $A$ can be uniquely written as the sum of a symmetric part, $\frac{A + A^{\top}}{2}$, and an antisymmetric part, $\frac{A - A^{\top}}{2}$. 
The first given condition, $A + A^{\top} = \frac{1}{n}J$, allows us to directly identify the symmetric part of $A$ as $\frac{1}{2n}J$. 
We can therefore express $A$ as the sum $A = \frac{1}{2n}J + B$, where $B = A - \frac{1}{2n}J = \frac{A - A^{\top}}{2}$ is, by definition, an antisymmetric matrix. 

With this decomposition in hand, we can use the second condition, $AJ = \frac{1}{2}J$, to find a relationship between $B$ and $J$. 
Substituting our expression for $A$ yields $\qty(\frac{1}{2n} J + B)J = \frac{1}{2}J$. 
the matrix $J$ as the property $J^2 = nJ$, which simplifies the equation to $BJ = 0$. 
By transposing this equation, we also find $\qty(BJ)^{\top} = J^{\top}B^{\top} = -JB = 0$, which means $JB = 0$. 

The fact that $BJ = JB = 0$ provides a powerful simplification for powers of $A$. 
When we expand $A^m = \qty(\frac{1}{2n}J + B)^m$ using the binomial theorem, every cross-term will contain a product $J$ and $B$, and will thus be zero. 
This leaves only the pure powers of each component:

$$
  A^m = \frac{1}{\qty(2n)^m}J^m + B^m
$$

Using the property $J^k = n^{k-1}J$ for $k \geq 1$, this further simplifies to:

$$
  A^m = \frac{1}{2^m n} J + B^m
$$

Now, let us assume there exists a vector $v$ such that $A^m v = v$. 
Applying $J$ to our eigenvector equation, we get $J \qty(A^m v) = Jv$. 
Since $A^m = \frac{1}{2^m n} J + B^m$ and $JB = 0$, this implies $\frac{1}{2^m}Jv = Jv$. 
Rearranging the terms gives $\qty(1 - \frac{1}{2^m})Jv = 0$. 
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the scalar factor is nonzero, which forces the conclusion that $Jv = 0$. 

We can now substitute the result $Jv = 0$ back into our decomposed expression for $A^m v$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  v &= A^mv = \frac{1}{2^m n} \qty(Jv) + B^m v = B^m v
\end{aligned}
$$

The final step of the proof relies on the fact that $m$ is a positive odd integer. 
Because $B$ is antisymmetric, $B^m$ must also be antisymmetric. 
The equation $v = B^m v$ allows us to analyze the squared norm of $v$:

$$
  \norm{v}^2 = v^{\top}v = v^{\top} \qty(B^m v)
$$

For any real antisymmetric matric $C$ and any real vector $x$, the quadratic form $x^{\top}Cx$ is always zero. 
In our case, this means $v^{\top}B^m v = 0$. 

Therefore, we must have $\norm{v}^2 = 0$, which implies that $v$ is the zero vector. 
We have shown that the only vector can satisfy $A^m v = v$ is $v = 0$. 
This means that $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $A^m$, and consequently, the matrix $A^m - I$ is invertible.

**Problem 7.**
The sequence $\qty{a_n}$ is a decreasing sequence where all terms are positive, and $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$. 
Show that the following inequality holds:

$$
  \abs{\sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \cos \qty( n \theta )} \leq \frac{\pi a_1}{\theta}
$$

**Solution:**
The structure of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \cos \qty(n \theta)$, which pairs a monotonically decreasing sequence $a_n$ with an oscillating term $\cos \qty(n \theta)$, suggests that the technique of [summation by parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts) will be an effective method of analysis. 
This approach allows us to separate the monotonic and oscillatory behaviors. 
To apply it, we first require a uniform bound on the partial sums of the cosine terms, $S_k = \sum_{n=1}^k \cos \qty(n \theta)$. 

A standard method to find a closed form for $S_k$ is to multiply by $2 \sin \qty(\theta/2)$ and use the product-to-sum identity $2 \cos A \sin B = \sin \qty(A+B) - \sin \qty(A-B)$. 
This transforms the sum into a telescoping series:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  2\sin \qty(\theta/2) S_k &= \sum_{n=1}^k 2\cos \qty(n \theta) \sin \qty(\theta/2) \\
  &= \sum_{n=1}^k \qty[\sin \qty(\qty(n + \frac{1}{2}) \theta) - \sin \qty(\qty(n - \frac{1}{2}) \theta)]
\end{aligned}
$$

This sum collapses, leaving:

$$
  S_k =  \frac{\sin\qty(\qty(k+\frac{1}{2})\theta) - \sin\qty(\theta/2)}{2\sin \qty(\theta/2)}
$$

We can now bound its magnitude. 
Using the triangle inequality on the numerator gives $\abs{S_k} \leq \frac{1}{\sin \qty(\theta/2)}$. 

With this bound established, we proceed with summation by parts. 
Letting $S_0 = 0$, we express $\cos \qty(n \theta)$ as $S_n - S_{n-1}$ and rearrange the original sum:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \cos \qty(n \theta) &= \sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \qty(S_n - S_{n-1}) \\
  &= a_{2017} S_{2017} + \sum_{n=1}^{2016} \qty(a_n - a_{n+1}) S_n
\end{aligned}
$$

Applying the triangle inequality to this transformed sum, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \abs{\sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \cos \qty(n \theta)} &\leq \abs{a_{2017}} \abs{S_{2017}} + \sum_{n=1}^{2016} \abs{a_n - a_{n+1}} \abs{S_n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the sequence $\qty{a_n}$ is decreasing and all its terms are positive, we know that $a_n - a_{n+1} \geq 0$ and $a_{2017} > 0$. 
We can therefore remove the absolte value signs from these terms. 
Substituting our uniform bound $\abs{S_n} \leq \frac{1}{\sin \qty(\theta/2)}$ yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \abs{\sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \cos \qty(n \theta)} &\leq \frac{a_{2017}}{\sin \qty(\theta/2)} + \sum_{n=1}^{2016} \frac{a_n - a_{n+1}}{\sin \qty(\theta/2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The terms on the right-hand side can be combined. 
The sum is a telescoping series, which simplifies the expression considerably:

$$
  \frac{1}{\sin(\theta/2)} \qty( \sum_{n=1}^{2016} \qty(a_n - a_{n+1}) + a_{2017} ) = \frac{a_1}{\sin(\theta/2)}
$$

This provides the inequality $\abs{\sum_{n=1}^{2017} a_n \cos \qty(n \theta)} \leq \frac{a_1}{\sin \qty(\theta/2)}$. 
To complete the proof, we must relate this to the desired bound by showing that $\frac{1}{\sin \qty(\theta/2)} \leq \frac{\pi}{\theta}$. 
This is equivalent to the inequality $\sin \qty(\theta/2) \geq \frac{\theta}{\pi}$. 
This result follows from the well-known [Jordan's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%27s_inequality), which states that $\sin x \geq \frac{2x}{\pi}$ for all $x \in \qty[0, \pi/2]$. 
This establishes the required inequality. 

**Problem 8.**
Let $u \qty(t)$ be the solution to the following differential equation:

$$
  \begin{cases}
    u'' \qty(t) + u' \qty(t) = \sin \qty(u \qty(t)) & \qty(t > 0) \\
    u \qty(0) = 1, \; u' \qty(0) = 0 &
  \end{cases}
$$

(1) Show that the functions $u \qty(t)$ and $u' \qty(t)$ are bounded for $t > 0$. 
(2) Find the limit $\lim_{t \to \infty} u \qty(t)$.
