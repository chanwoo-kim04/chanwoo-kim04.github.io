## Division 1 (Majors in Mathematics & Related Fields)

**Problem 1.**
For the following matrix $A$, find the real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$ holds. (Here, $I$ is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix).

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 1 \\
    -1 & 0 & 1 \\
    -1 & -1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Solution Strategy:**
The goal is to simplify the high-degree matrix polynomial $A^5$ into a linear combination of $A^2$, $A$, and $I$. 
The most direct method is to use the [Cayley-Hamilton theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem), which states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. 
This will provide a low-degree polynomial relation that can be used to recursively reduce the power of $A^5$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Find the Characteristic Equation:* We compute the characteristic equation, $\det \qty(A - \lambda I) = 0$.
    
    $$
      \det \begin{pmatrix}
        -\lambda & 1 & 1 \\
        -1 & -\lambda & 1 \\
        -1 & -1 & -\lambda
      \end{pmatrix} = 0
    $$
    
    Expanding the determinant gives $\lambda^3 + 3\lambda = 0$. 

2. *Apply the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem:*
    The theorem states that matrix $A$ must satisfy its own characteristic equation.
    By substituting $A$ for $\lambda$, we get $A^3 + 3A = O$, where $O$ is the zero matrix.
    This gives us the relation $A^3 = -3A$.

3. *Reduce the Power of $A^5$:*
    We use the relation from Step 2 to simplify $A^5$:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      A^5 &= A^2 \cdot A^3 = A^2 \cdot \qty(-3A) = -3A^3 = -3\qty(-3A) = 9A
    \end{aligned}
    $$

4. *Conclusion:*
    We are given the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$.
    By compairing the coefficients, we find $a = 0$, $b = 9$, and $c = 0$. 

**Problem 2.**
In $3$-dimensional coordinate space, let $S$ be the surface given by the equation $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$.
Show that the surface $S$ contains exactly two lines that pass through the point $P \qty(1, 2, 1)$, and find the value of $\cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the acute angle between these two lines.

**Solution Strategy:** 
The core idea is to substitute the parametric equation of a general line passing through the given point into the equation of surface. 
Since the line must lie entirely on the surface, the resulting polynomial in the parameter must be an identity. 
By setting the coefficients of this polynomial to zero, we obtain a system of equations that can be solved to find the two possible direction vectors for the lines.

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 
1. *Define the Parametric Line:*
    The line through $P \qty(1, 2, 1)$ with direction vector $\qty(a, b, c)$ is:
    
    $$
      x = 1 + at, \quad y = 2 + bt, \quad z = 1 + ct
    $$

2. *Form the Identity in $t$:*
    Substitute the equations of line into the surface equation $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$:
    
    $$
      4\qty(1 + ct)^2 = \qty(1 + at)^2 + \qty(2 + bt)^2 - 1
    $$
    
    Expanding and simplifying this equation yields a polynomial in $t$:
    
    $$
      \qty(4c^2 - a^2 - b^2)t^2 + \qty(8c - 2a - 4b)t = 0
    $$

3. *Solve for the Direction Vectors:*
    For this equation to hold for all $t$, the coefficients must be zero.
    This gives a sysmte of equations:
    
    (1) $4c^2 - a^2 - b^2 = 0$  
    (2) $a = 4c - 2b$
    
    Substitute (2) into (1) gives $\qty(6c - 5b)\qty(2c-b)= 0$. 
    This yields two distinct ratios for the direction vector:
    
    - If $2c - b = 0$, then $b = 2c$. Substituting into $a = 4c - 2b$ gives $a = 0$.
      The direction vector is $\vec{v}_1 = \qty(0, 2, 1)$.
    - If $6c - 5b = 0$, then $b = (6/5)c$. Substituting into $a = 4c - 2b$ gives $a = (8/5)c$.
      The direction vector is $\vec{v}_2 = \qty(8, 6, 5)$.

4. *Calculate the Angle:*
    Use the dot product formula with $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \cos \theta &= \frac{\vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2}{\norm{\vec{v}_1}\norm{\vec{v}_1}} \\
      &= \frac{0 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 6 + 1 \cdot 5}{\sqrt{0^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} \cdot \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2 + 5^2}} = \frac{17}{25}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

**Problem 3.**
Find the real number $N$ that satisfies the following equation:

$$
  \sum_{k=1}^{2024} \qty(2025-k) \cdot 2024^k \cdot 2025^{2024-k} = 2024^N
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
The presence of both $k$ and $\qty(2025-k)$ terms within the sum is a strong indicator of a symmetrical structure, suggesting a substitution that reverses the order of summation will be highly effective. 
Introducing a new index, such as $j = 2025-k$, is expected to transform the expression into a much more manageable form. 
After simplified, we can expect that the sum can be evaluated by applying a known identity, which is typically derived from the derivative of a finite geometric series. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 
1. *Apply Index Substitution:*
    Let $S$ be the given summation:
    
    $$
      S = \sum_{k=1}^{2024} \qty(2025-k) \cdot 2024^k \cdot 2025^{2024-k}
    $$
    
    We apply the index substitution $j = 2025-k$. 
    As $k$ rums from $1$ to $2024$, $j$ runs from $2024$ down to $1$. 
    This reverses the order of the sum, which can be rewritten as:
    
    $$
      S = \sum_{j=1}^{2024} j \cdot 2024^{2025-j} \cdot 2025^{j-1}
    $$

2. *Reaarange into a Standard Series Form:*
    We factor out terms not dependent on the index $j$ to isolate a standard arithmetic-geometric series:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      S &= \sum_{j=1}^{2024} j \cdot 2024^{2025-j} \cdot 2025^{j-1} \\
      &= \frac{2024^{2025}}{2025} \sum_{j=1}^{2024} j \qty(\frac{2025}{2024})^j
    \end{aligned}
    $$

3. *Evaluate the Series Using a Known Identity:*
    The core problem is to find the value of the sereis $\sum_{j=1}^{2024} j \cdot r^j$, where $r = 2025/2024$.
    We will derive a general formla for this.
    
    The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:
    
    $$
      G \qty(r) = \sum_{j=1}^n r^j = \frac{r - r^{n+1}}{1-r}
    $$
    
    To introduce the coefficient $j$, we differentiate both sides with respect to $r$:
    
    $$
      \dv{G}{r} = \sum_{j=1}^n \dv{}{r}\qty(r^j) = \sum_{j=1}^n j \cdot r^{j-1}
    $$
    
    Using the quotient rule on the right-hand side $\qty(r-r^{n+1})/\qty(1-r)$:
    
    $$
      \dv{G}{r} = \frac{1 - \qty(n+1)r^n + nr^{n+1}}{\qty(1-r)^2}
    $$
    
    Our target series is $\sum j \cdot r^j$. 
    This is simply $r$ times the derivative we just found:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \sum_{j=1}^n j \cdot r^j &= r \sum_{j=1}^n j \cdot r^{j-1} = r \cdot \dv{G}{r} \\
      &= \frac{r \qty(1 - \qty(n+1)r^n + nr^{n+1})}{\qty(1-r)^2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Now, substituting $n = 2024$ and $r = 2025/2024$ into this formula gives:
    
    $$
      \sum_{j=1}^n j \cdot \qty(\frac{2025}{2024})^j = 2025 \cdot 2024
    $$

4. *Calculate the Final Result:*

    Now we substitute the value of the series back into the expression for $S$:
    
    $$
      S = \frac{2024^{2025}}{2025} \cdot \qty(2024 \cdot 2025) = 2024^{2026}
    $$
    
    The problem states that $S = 2024^{N}$. By direct comparison, $N = 2026$. 

**Problem 4.**
Find the tesn digit and the units digit of $37^{2024}$, respectively.

**Solution Strategy:** 
The task of finding the last two digits of a number is a classic modular arithmetic problem. The key is to recognize that this is equivalent to finding the number's remainder modulo $100$. This problem can be readily solved by applying two powerful tools from number theory: the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) and [Euler's Totient Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem).

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Decompose the Problem with the Chinese Remainder Theorem:*
    Our goal is to find the value $37^{2024} \pmod{100}$.
    Since $100 = 4 \times 25$, we can solve this by finding the value of $37^{2024} \pmod{4}$ and $37^{2024}\pmod{25}$.

2. *Solve the Congruence Modulo $4$:*
    Since $37 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, the original congruence becomes $37^{2024} \equiv 1^{2024} \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

3. *Solve the Congruence Modulo $25$:*
    By reducing the base, we get $37^{2025} \equiv 12^{2025} \pmod{25}$. 
    We use Euler's totient theorem, where $\varphi \qty(25) = 20$.
    This gives us $12^{20} \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$.
    So, we can calculate:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      12^{2024} &\equiv \qty(\qty(12)^{20})^{101} \cdot 12^4 \equiv 1^{1-1} \cdot 12^4 \equiv \pmod{25}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Finally, $12^4 \equiv 144^2 \equiv \qty(-6)^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 11 \pmod{25}$. 
    Thus, $37^{2024} \equiv 11 \pmod{25}$. 

4. *Combine the Results:*
    We now solve the system $x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and $x \equiv 11 \pmod{25}$.
    From the second congruence, we know $x = 25k + 11$ for some integer $k$.
    Substitute this into the first congruence:
    
    $$
      25k + 11 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \implies k \equiv 2 \pmod{4}
    $$
    
    So, $k$ must be of the form $4n + 2$. 
    Substitute this back into the expression for $x$:
    
    $$
      x = 25 \qty(4n + 2) + 11 = 100 n + 61
    $$
    
    This means $x \equiv 61 \pmod{100}$. 
    The last two digits are $61$, so the tens digit is $6$ and the units digit is $1$. 

**Problem 5.**
Let $f \qty(x)$ be a real-valued function defined on the set of all real numbers. $f \qty(x)$ is twice differentiable, and $f'' \qty(x)$ is contiuous.
For all $x$, $f' \qty(x) > 0$ and $f'' \qty(x) < 0$.
Prove that for any positive number $t$, the following inequality holds:

$$
  \int_0^t \cos \qty(f \qty(x)) \dd x \leq \frac{2}{f' \qty(t)}
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
The core starategy is to find an upper bound for the integral, as direct evaluation is impossible. 
The term $f' \qty(t)$ in the terget inequality is a clear indicator that Integration by Parts is the central technique. 
The crucial step is to prepare the integrand for this method by connecting it to its antiderivative. 
This is achieved by rewriting $\cos \qty(f \qty(x))$ as the product of $1/f' \qty(x)$ and $\dv{}{x}\sin \qty(f\qty(x))$. 
The subsequent step would be to analyze the resulting expression and see if the given conditions, along with the bound for the sine function, are sufficient to derive the final inequality.

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Apply Integration by Parts:*
    Since $f' \qty(x) > 0$, we can express then integrand in a form suitable for Integration by Parts:
    
    $$
      \int_0^t \cos \qty( f\qty(x)) \dd x = \int_0^t \frac{1}{f' \qty(x)} \cdot \dv{}{x}\qty[\sin \qty(f \qty(x))] \dd x
    $$
    
    Applying the integration by parts formula yields:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \int_0^t \cos \qty( f\qty(x)) \dd x &= \qty[\frac{\sin \qty(f \qty(x))}{f' \qty(x)}]_0^t - \int_0^t \sin \qty(f \qty(x)) \qty(-\frac{f'' \qty(x)}{\qty(f' \qty(x))^2}) \dd x \\
      &= \frac{\sin \qty(f \qty(t))}{f' \qty(t)} - \frac{\sin \qty(f\qty(0))}{f' \qty(0)} + \int_0^t \frac{f'' \qty(x) \sin \qty( f\qty(x))}{\qty(f' \qty(x))^2} \dd x
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. *Establish an Upper Bound:*
    We bound the expression using the triangle inequality and the given conditions:
    
    $$
      \int_0^t \cos \qty( f\qty(x)) \dd x \leq \abs{\frac{\sin \qty(f \qty(t))}{f' \qty(t)}} + \abs{\frac{\sin \qty(f\qty(0))}{f' \qty(0)}} + \int_0^t \abs{\frac{f'' \qty(x) \sin \qty( f\qty(x))}{\qty(f' \qty(x))^2}} \dd x
    $$
    
    Using $\abs{\sin \theta} \leq $, $f' \qty(x) > 0$, and $\abs{f'' \qty(x)} = -f'' \qty(x)$, this simlifies to
    
    $$
      \int_0^t \cos \qty( f\qty(x)) \dd x \leq \frac{1}{f' \qty(t)} + \frac{1}{f' \qty(0)} + \int_0^t \frac{- f'' \qty(x)}{\qty(f' \qty(x))^2} \dd x
    $$

3. *Evaluate the Remaining Integral and Conclude:*
    The final integral can be solved directly, as the integrand is the derivative of $1/ f' \qty(x)$:
    
    $$
      \int_0^t \frac{- f'' \qty(x)}{\qty(f' \qty(x))^2} \dd x = \frac{1}{f' \qty(t)} - \frac{1}{f' \qty(0)}
    $$
    
    Substituting this result back into the inequality from Step $3$:
    
    $$
      \int_0^t \cos \qty( f\qty(x)) \dd x \leq \frac{1}{f' \qty(t)} + \frac{1}{f' \qty(0)} + \qty(\frac{1}{f' \qty(t)} - \frac{1}{f' \qty(0)}) = \frac{2}{f' \qty(t)}
    $$
    
    This completes the proof.

**Problem 6.**
For $n$ real numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, \dots, $a_n$ that satisfy the two conditions below, find the maximum value of the expression $\qty(\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k a_{k+1}) + a_n a_1$. (Assume $n \geq 3$).

$$
  a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0, \quad a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2 = 1
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
This is a constrained optimization problem where the objective function and constraints exhibit a clear cyclic symmetry. 
This strong symmetry suggest that a linear algebra approach will be more natural than direct calculus methods, such as [Lagrange Multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier). The strategy is to reframe the problem in a vector space by representing the sequence $\qty(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ as a vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
The constraints then take on a geometric meaning: $\norm{\vec{v}}^2 = 1$ confines $\vec{v}$ to the unit sphere, while $\sum a_k = 0$ restricts $\vec{v}$ to a hyperplane orthogonal to the vector of all ones. 

The expression to be maximized can be interpreted as the quadratic form $S = \varphi \qty(\vec{v}) \cdot \vec{v}$, where $\varphi$ is the linear operator that performs a cyclic shift on the components of $\vec{v}$. 
The optimization of a quadratic form is fundamentally connected to the eigenvalues of its associated operator. 
Therefore, the plan is to find the eigenvalues of the cyclic shift operator. 
The maximum values of $S$ will correspond to the largest eigenvalue, but we must consider the constraint of orthgonality to the vector of all ones.

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Formulate the Problem in Linear Algebra:*

    Represent the variables as a vector $\vec{v} = \qty(a_1, \dots, a_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
    The expression to maximize is a quadratic form $S = \varphi \qty(\vec{v}) \cdot \vec{v}$, where $\varphi$ is the linear operator for a cyclic shift: $\varphi \qty(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) = \qty(a_2, \dots, a_n, 1)$. 
    The problem is to maximize $S$ subject to the constraints $\norm{\vec{v}}^2 = 1$ and $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} = 0$, where $\vec{u} = \qty(1,\dots, 1)$. 

2. *Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Operator:*

    The normalized eigenvectors of the cyclic shift operator $\varphi$ can be expressed as a form $\vec{v}_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\qty(\zeta_k, \zeta_k^2, \dots, \zeta_k^n)$, where $\zeta_k = e^{2\pi i k / n}$ for $k = 1$, \dots, $n$. 
    The corresponding eigenvalues are the $n$-th roots of unity themselves: $\lambda_k = \zeta_k$.
    
    $$
      \varphi \qty(\vec{v}_k) = \lambda_k \vec{v}_k = e^{2\pi i k / n} \vec{v}_k
    $$

3. *Express the Quadratic Form in the Eigenbasis:*

    Represent the real vector $\vec{v}$ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors: $\vec{v} = \sum_{k=1}^n c\_k \vec{v}\_k$. 
    Because the eigenvectors are orthogonal, the quadratic form simplifies to $S = \sum\_{k=1}^n \abs{c_k}^2 \lambda_k$. 
    Since $S$ must be real, we take the real part:
    
    $$
      S = \sum_{k=1}^n \abs{c_k}^2 \Re \qty(\lambda_k) = \sum_{k=1}^n \abs{c_k}^2 \cos \frac{2\pi k}{n}
    $$

4. *Apply the Constraints to th Coefficients:*

    The constraint $\norm{\vec{v}}^2 = 1$ implies that the coefficients must satisfy $\sum_{k=1}^n \abs{c_k}^2 = 1$. 
    The constraint $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{u} = 0$ means $\vec{v}$ must be orthogonal to the vector of all ones. 
    Since the vector $\vec{u} = \sqrt{n}\vec{v}_n$ is the eigenvector of $\varphi$, the coefficient $c_n$ in the expansion of $v$ must be zero. 

5. *Determine the Maximum Value:*
    With $c_n = 0$, the problem reduces to maximizign the convex combination:
    
    $$
      S = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \abs{c_k}^2 \cos \frac{2\pi k}{n}, \quad\text{subject to } \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \abs{c_k}^2 = 1
    $$
    
    This expression is maximized when all the weight is placed on the term with the largest cosine value. 
    For $k \in \qty{1, \dots, n-1}$ and $n \geq 3$, the maximum value of $\cos \qty(2\pi k/n)$ occures when $k = 1$. 
    Therefore, the maximum value of $S$ is $\cos \qty(2\pi /n)$. 

**Problem 7.** 
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a finite, closed, convex region in the $2$-dimensional coordinate plane, and let its boundary $\beta$ satisfy the following conditions:
  
(1) $\beta$ is a smooth, simple closed curve.  
(2) For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the circle of radius $1$ centered at $O$ intersects $\beta$ at exactly two points.  
(3) For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the tangent line drawn at $O$ does not intersect $\beta$ at any other point besides $O$.  
  
Let $M$ be the midpoint of a rod $PQ$ of length $1$.
As the rod is moved such that its endpoints $P$ and $Q$ always lie on $\beta$ for one full revolution (i.e., $P$ and $Q$ move continuously along $\beta$ for one lap), the locus of $M$ forms a simple closed curve, which we call $\gamma$.
Show that the area of the region between the curves $\beta$ and $\gamma$ is $\frac{\pi}{4}$. 

**Solution Strategy:** 
This provlem involves finding the area between two parametrically defined loci, which makes [Green's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem) and its line integral formula for area the natural tool. 
The critical observation is that as the rod completes one cycle, both endpoints $P$ and $Q$ must individually trance the entire outer boundary $\beta$. This provides to distinct line integral representation for the same quantity, the area of $D$. 
By adding these two line integrals, we anticipate that the angle-depndent terms will cancel. 
This should reveal an algebraic relationship between twice of area of $D$ and the area enclosed by the midpoint's path.

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Set Up Parametrization and Area Formulas:*

    We use the line integral formula for area, $A = \frac{1}{2}\oint \qty(x \dd y - y \dd x)$. 
    Let the rod's midpoint be $M = \qty(x \qty(t), y \qty(t))$ and its angle with the $x$-axis be $t$. 
    The endpoints are then:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      P &= \qty(x_P, y_P) = \qty(x + \frac{1}{2} \cos t, y + \frac{1}{2} \sin t) \\
      Q &= \qty(x_Q, y_Q) = \qty(x - \frac{1}{2} \cos t, y - \frac{1}{2} \sin t) 
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. *Combine Two Expressions for area of $D$:*

    Since both endpoints $P$ and $Q$ trance the entire boundary $\beta$, we can express the area of region $D$ in two ways. 
    We add these two line integral expressions together:
    
    $$
      2 \text{Area} \qty(D) = \frac{1}{2} \oint \qty(x_P \dd y_P - y_P \dd x_P) + \frac{1}{2} \qty(x_Q \dd y_Q - y_Q \dd x_Q)
    $$

3. *Substitute and Simplify the Combined Integral:*

    We substitute the parametrziations for $P$ and $Q$ into the combined integral. 
    The differentials are $\dd x_P = \dd x - \frac{1}{2} \sin t \dd t$, $\dd y_P = \dd y + \frac{1}{2}\cos t \dd t$, and similarly for $Q$. 
    After expansion, the terms involving the rod's orientation simplify significantly. 
    The combined integrand becomes:
    
    $$
      \qty(x_P \dd y_P - y_P \dd x_P) + \qty(x_Q \dd y_Q - y_Q \dd x_Q) = 2 \qty(x \dd y - y \dd x) + \frac{1}{2} \dd t
    $$
    
    Substituting this back into the expression for $2 \text{Area} \qty(D)$:
    
    $$
      2\text{Area} \qty(D) = \frac{1}{2}\oint \qty(2 \qty(x \dd y - y \dd x) + \frac{1}{2}\dd t)
    $$

4. *Relate to* $\text{Area} \qty(E)$ *and Solve for the Difference:*

    We can now split the integral:
    
    $$
      2\text{Area} \qty(D) = \oint \qty(x \dd y - y \dd x) + \frac{1}{4} \oint \dd t
    $$
    
    Recognize that $\oint \qty(x \dd y - y \dd x)$ is $2 \text{Area} \qty(E)$. 
    As the rod completes one full circle, the angle $t$ changes by $2\pi$, so $\oint \dd t = 2\pi$. 
    
    $$
      2\text{Area} \qty(D) = 2 \text{Area} \qty(E) + \frac{\pi}{2}
    $$
    
    Therefore, the diffenrece in the areas is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.

**Problem 1.** 
For the following matrix $A$, find the real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$ holds. (Here, $I$ is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix).

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 1 \\
    -1 & 0 & 1 \\
    -1 & -1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
This problem is identical to *Problem 1 in Division 1*. Please refer to the solution in that section for a detailed walkthrough.

**Problem 2.** 
Find the solution $y \qty(x)$ of the following differential equation:

$$
  \dv{y}{x} = \frac{x + y - 2}{x - y}, \quad \text{with } y \qty(1) = 0
$$

**Solution Strategy:** The structure of differential equation, with linear expressions in the numerator and denominator, suggests a coordinate shift. 
The core strategy is to transform the problem into a standard homogeneous equation by translating the origin to the intersection points of the lines $x + y - 2 = 0$ and $x - y = 0$. 
Once in homogeneous form, the equation can be solved using the standard technieques in ordinary differential equations.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. *Transform to a Homogeneous Equation:*
    Find the intersection of the lines $x + y - 2 = 0$ and $x - y = 0$, which is $\qty(1, 1)$.
   Substitute $u = x-1$ and $v = y-1$ to transform the equation into the homogeneous form:
    
    $$
      \dv{v}{u} = \frac{u + v}{u - v}, \quad v \qty(0) = -1
    $$

2. *Make the EQuation Separable:*
    Use the substitution $v = zu$, which implies $\dv{v}{u} = z + u \dv{z}{u}$.
    After algebraic manipulation, this yields the separable equation:
    
    $$
      \frac{z-1}{z^2 - 2z - 1} \dd z = \frac{1}{u} \dd u
    $$

3. *Integrate and Revert to Original Varabiles:*
    Integrating yields $\frac{1}{2} \ln \abs{z^2 - 2z - 1} = \ln \abs{u} + C$.
    This can be simplified by exponentiating and combining constants to $z^2 - 2z - 1 = C_0 / u^2$.
    Now, substitute back $z = v/u$ and multiply by $u^2$ to get an implicit solution in $u$ and $v$:
    
    $$
      v^2 - 2uv - u^2 = C_0
    $$
    
    Solving for $v$ using the quadratic formula gives:
    
    $$
      v = u \pm \sqrt{2u^2 + C_0}
    $$
    
    Then, substitute $u = x-1$ and $v = y-1$ to get the general solution:
    
    $$
      y = x \pm \sqrt{2\qty(x-1)^2 + C_0}
    $$

4. *Apply the Initial Conditoin:*
    Use the condition $y \qty(1) = 0$ in the general solution:
    
    $$
      0 = 1 \pm \sqrt{2 \qty(1-1)^2 + C_0}
    $$
    
    This implies that $C_0 = 1$ and that the negative sign must be chosen. 
    Therefore, the desired solution is:
    
    $$
      y = x - \sqrt{2 \qty(x-1)^2 + 1}
    $$

**Problem 3.** 
For a positive number $a$, let $V$ be a solid $3$-dimensional space defined as follows:

$$
  V = \qty{\qty(x, y, z) \colon x^2 + y^2 + \qty(z-1)^2 \leq 1, \quad z \geq \sqrt{a \qty(x^2 + y^2)}}
$$

When the volume of the solid $V$ is $\frac{7\pi}{12}$, find the value of $a$. 

**Solution Strategy:** 
The strategy is to use cylindrical coordinates due to the solid's axial symmetry. The key is to first find the radial limit of integration by solving for the intersection of the sphere and cone surfaces. Then, the volume can be found by integrating the height difference between the sphere and the cone over the circular area defined by that radial limit. Evaluating this integral will yield the volume as a function of $a$, which can then be set equal to the given value to solve for $a$. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Convert to Cylindrical Coordinates:*
    The sphere $x^2 + y^2 + \qty(z-1)^2 = 1$ becomes $r^2 + \qty(z-1)^2 = 1$.
    The upper surface is $z = 1 + \sqrt{1-r^2}$.
    The cone $z = \sqrt{a \qty(x^2 + y^2)}$ becomes the lower space $z = \sqrt{a}r$.
   
2. *Find the Radius of Intersection:*
    To find the limit for $r$, set the surface equal by substituting the cone equation into the sphere equation:
    
    $$
      r^2 + \qty(\sqrt{ar} - 1)^2 = 1
    $$
    
    Expanding and simplifying gives: $ \qty(a+1)r^2 - 2\sqrt{a}r = 0$, which gives the non-zero solution $r = \frac{2\sqrt{a}}{a+1}$.

3. *Calculate the Volume:*
    The volume $V$ is the integral of the hight difference multiplied by the area element $r \dd r \dd \theta$.
    The integral is:
    
    $$
      V  = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\sqrt{a}/\qty(a+1)} \qty(1 + \sqrt{1 - r^2} - \sqrt{a}r)r \dd r \dd \theta
    $$
    
    Integrating with respect to $\theta$ from $0$ to $2\pi$ introduces a factor of $2\pi$. 
    The integral with respect to $r$ evaluates to:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      V \qty(a) &= 2 \pi \qty[\frac{1}{2}r^2 - \frac{\sqrt{a}}{3} r^3 - \frac{1}{3} \qty(1-r^2)^{3/2}]_0^{2\sqrt{a}/\qty(a+1)} \\
      &= \frac{4\pi}{3} \frac{2a + 1}{\qty(a+1)^2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

4. *Solve for $a$:*
    Set the resulting expression equal to the given volume:
    
    $$
      \frac{4\pi}{3} \frac{2a + 1}{\qty(a+1)^2} = \frac{7\pi}{12}
    $$
    
    Simplifying the equation leads to the quadratic $7a^2 - 18a - 9 = 0$. 
    Factoring gives $\qty(7a + 3) \qty(a-3) = 0$. 
    Since the problem states $a > 0$, the only valid solution is $a = 3$. 

**Problem 4.** 
Find the real number $N$ that satisfies the following equation

$$
  \sum_{k=1}^{2024} \qty(2025-k) \cdot 2024^k \cdot 2025^{2024-k} = 2024^N
$$

**Solution Strategy:**
This problem is identical to *Problem 3 in Division 1*. Please refer to the solution in that section for a detailed walkthrough.

**Problem 5.** 
Find the value of the following improper integral:

$$
  \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{\qty(x^{2024} + 1) \qty(x^2 + 1)} \dd x
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
The integral appears daunting due to the high power of $x$, suggesting a direct attack is infeasible. 
The core strategy is to exploit a symmetry by applying the appropriate substitution.

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Apply Appropirate Substitution:*
    Let the given integral be $I$.
    
    $$
      I = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{\qty(x^{2024}+1) \qty(x^2 + 1)} \dd x
    $$
    
    Perform the substitution $x=1/t$, which means $\dd x = \qty(-1/t^2) \dd t$. 
    The limit of integration changes: as $x \to 0$, $t \to \infty$, and as $x \to \infty$, $t \to 0$. 
    
    Substituting this into the integral gives:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      I = \int_{\infty}^{0} \frac{1}{\qty(\qty(1/t)^{2024} + 1) \qty(\qty(1/t)^2 + 1)} \qty(-\frac{1}{t^2} \dd t) \\
      &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{2024}}{\qty(t^{2024} + 1)\qty(t^2 + 1)} \dd t
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    Since the variable of integration is a dummy variable, we can write this as:
    
    $$
      I = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{x^{2024}}{\qty(x^{2024}+1) \qty(x^2 + 1)} \dd x
    $$

2. *Combine the Two Forms of the Integral:*
Now, add the original expression for $I$ to the new one:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  2I &= \int_0^\infty \frac{1 + x^{2024}}{\qty(x^{2024} + 1) \qty(x^2 + 1)} \dd x \\
  &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2 + 1} \dd x \\
  &= \qty[\arctan x]_0^{\infty} = \frac{\pi}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the value of the original integral is $I = \frac{\pi}{4}$. 

**Problem 6.** 
For $n \times N$ real matrices $A$ and $B$, prove the following inequality when $\rank \qty(B) = 1$. (Assume $n \geq 2$).

$$
  \det \qty(A + B) \det \qty(A-B) \leq \qty(\det \qty(A))^2
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
The strategy is to leverage the $\rank \qty(B) = 1$ condition by representing $B$ as an outer product, $\vec{u}\vec{v}^{\top}$. 
This transforms the problem into analyzing $\det \qty(A \pm $\vec{u}\vec{v}^{\top})$, which is a standard "rank-$1$ update" structure. 
This specific form immediately suggest using the [Matrix Determinant Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_determinant_lemma). 
The singular case can be handled with a continuity argument. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 

1. *Represent $B$ as a Rank-$1$ Outer Product:*
    Since $\rank \qty(B) = 1$, it can be written as the outer product of two column vectors, $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$: $B = $\vec{u}\vec{v}^{\top}$.

2. *Handle the Case Where $A$ is Invertible:*
    Assume $A$ is invertible.
    We can now apply the Matrix Determinant Lemma.
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \det \qty(A + $\vec{u}\vec{v}^{\top}) &= \det \qty(A) \qty(1 + \vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u}) \\
      \det \qty(A - $\vec{u}\vec{v}^{\top}) &= \det \qty(A) \qty(1 - \vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

3. *Multiply the Expressions:*
    Now, multiply the left and right sides of these two equations:
    
    $$
    \begin{alignd}
      \det \qty(A+B) \det \qty(A-B) &= \det \qty(A) \qty(1 + \vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u}) \det \qty(A) \qty(1 - \vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u}) \\
      &= \qty(\det \qty(A))^2 \qty(1 - \qty(\vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u})^2)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

4. *Prove the Inequality:*
    The term $\vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u}$ is a scalar.
    The square of any real scalar is non-negative.
    Therefore, the factor $\qty(1 - \qty(\vec{v}^{\top} A^{-1} \vec{u})^2)$ must be less than or equal to $1$.
    This completes the proof for an invertible matrix $A$.

5. *Handle the Case Where $A$ is Singular:*
    If $A$ is singular, $\det \qty(A) = 0$, and the Matrix Determinant Lemma cannot be directly applied.
    However, we can use a continuity argument.
    Consider the matrix $A \qty(\eps) = A - \eps I$, where $\eps$ is a small real number.
    For almost all small values of $\eps$, $A \qty(\eps)$ will be invertible.
    
    The inequality holds for $A \qty(\eps)$: 
    
    $$
      \det \qty(A \qty(\eps) + B)\det \qty(A \qty(\eps) - B) \leq \qty(\det\qty(A \qty(\eps)))^2
    $$
    
    The determinant is a continuous function of the entries of a matrix. 
    Taking the limit as $\eps \to 0$, $A \qty(\eps) \to A$. 
    Therefore, we have:
    
    $$
      \lim_{\eps \to 0}\det \qty(A \qty(\eps) + B)\det \qty(A \qty(\eps) - B) \leq \lim_{\eps \to 0}\qty(\det\qty(A \qty(\eps)))^2
    $$
    
    This gives $\det \qty(A+B) \det \qty(A-B) \leq \qty(\det \qty(A))^2$, proving the result holds for singular mattrices as well.

**Problem 7.** 
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a finite, closed, convex region in the $2$-dimensional coordinate plane, and let its boundary $\beta$ satisfy the following conditions:
  
(1) $\beta$ is a smooth, simple closed curve.  
(2) For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the circle of radius $1$ centered at $O$ intersects $\beta$ at exactly two points.  
(3) For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the tangent line drawn at $O$ does not intersect $\beta$ at any other point besides $O$.  
  
Let $M$ be the midpoint of a rod $PQ$ of length $1$.
As the rod is moved such that its endpoints $P$ and $Q$ always lie on $\beta$ for one full revolution (i.e., $P$ and $Q$ move continuously along $\beta$ for one lap), the locus of $M$ forms a simple closed curve, which we call $\gamma$.
Show that the area of the region between the curves $\beta$ and $\gamma$ is $\frac{\pi}{4}$. 

**Solution Strategy:**
This problem is identical to *Problem 7 in Division 1*. Please refer to the solution in that section for a detailed walkthrough.
