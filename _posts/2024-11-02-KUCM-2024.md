## Division 1 (Majors in Mathematics & Related Fields)

**Problem 1.**
For the following matrix $A$, find the real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$ holds. (Here, $I$ is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix).

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 1 \\
    -1 & 0 & 1 \\
    -1 & -1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Solution Strategy:**
The goal is to simplify the high-degree matrix polynomial $A^5$ into a linear combination of $A^2$, $A$, and $I$. 
The most direct method is to use the [Cayley-Hamilton theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem), which states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. 
This will provide a low-degree polynomial relation that can be used to recursively reduce the power of $A^5$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Find the Characteristic Equation:* We compute the characteristic equation, $\det \qty(A - \lambda I) = 0$.
    
    $$
      \det \begin{pmatrix}
        -\lambda & 1 & 1 \\
        -1 & -\lambda & 1 \\
        -1 & -1 & -\lambda
      \end{pmatrix} = 0
    $$
    
    Expanding the determinant gives $\lambda^3 + 3\lambda = 0$. 

2. *Apply the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem:*
    The theorem states that matrix $A$ must satisfy its own characteristic equation.
    By substituting $A$ for $\lambda$, we get $A^3 + 3\lambda = O$, where $O$ is the zero matrix.
    This gives us the relation $A^3 = -3A$.

3. *Reduce the Power of $A^5$:*
    We use the relation from Step 2 to simplify $A^5$:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      A^5 &= A^2 \cdot A^3 = A^2 \cdot \qty(-3A) = -3A^3 = -3\qty(-3A) = 9A
    \end{aligned}
    $$

4. *Conclusion:*
    We are given the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$.
    By compairing the coefficients, we find $a = 0$, $b = 9$, and $c = 0$. 

**Problem 2.**
In $3$-dimensional coordinate space, let $S$ be the surface given by the equation $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$.
Show that the surface $S$ contains exactly two lines that pass through the point $P \qty(1, 2, 1)$, and find the value of $\cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the acute angle between these two lines.

**Solution Strategy:** 
The core idea is to substitute the parametric equation of a general line passing through the given point into the equation of surface. 
Since the line must lie entirely on the surface, the resulting polynomial in the parameter must be an identity. 
By setting the coefficients of this polynomial to zero, we obtain a system of equations that can be solved to find the two possible direction vectors for the lines.

**Step-by-Step Solution:** 
1. *Define the Parametric Line:*
    The line through $P \qty(1, 2, 1)$ with direction vector $\qty(a, b, c)$ is:
    
    $$
      x = 1 + at, \quad y = 2 + bt, \quad z = 1 + ct
    $$

2. *Form the Identity in $t$:*
    Substitute the equations of line into the surface equation $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$:
    
    $$
      4\qty(1 + ct)^2 = \qty(1 + at)^2 + \qty(2 + bt)^2 - 1
    $$
    
    Expanding and simplifying this equation yields a polynomial in $t$:
    
    $$
      \qty(4c^2 - a^2 - b^2)t^2 + \qty(8c - 2a - 4b)t = 0
    $$

3. *Solve for the Direction Vectors:*
    For this equation to hold for all $t$, the coefficients must be zero.
    This gives a sysmte of equations:
    
    (1) $4c^2 - a^2 - b^2 = 0$  
    (2) $a = 4c - 2b$
    
    Substitute (2) into (1) gives $\qty(6c - 5b)\qty(2c-b)= 0$. 
    This yields two distinct ratios for the direction vector:
    
    - If $2c - b = 0$, then $b = 2c$. Substituting into $a = 4c - 2b$ gives $a = 0$.
      The direction vector is $\vec{v}_1 = \qty(0, 2, 1)$.
    - If $6c - 5b = 0$, then $b = (6/5)c$. Substituting into $a = 4c - 2b$ gives $a = (8/5)c$.
      The direction vector is $\vec{v}_2 = \qty(8, 6, 5)$.

4. *Calculate the Angle:*
    Use the dot product formula with $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      \cos \theta &= \frac{\vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2}{\norm{\vec{v}_1}\norm{\vec{v}_1}} \\
      &= \frac{0 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 6 + 1 \cdot 5}{\sqrt{0^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} \cdot \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2 + 5^2}} = \frac{17}{25}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

**Problem 3.**
Find the real number $N$ that satisfies the following equation:

$$
  \sum_{k=1}^{2024} \qty(2025-k) \cdot 2024^k \cdot 2025^{2024-k} = 2024^N
$$

**Solution Strategy:** 
The presence of both $k$ and $\qty(2025-k)$ terms within the sum is a strong indicator of a symmetrical structure, suggesting a substitution that reverses the order of summation will be highly effective. 
Introducing a new index, such as $j = 2025-k$, is expected to transform the expression into a much more manageable form. 
Once simplified, the next objective is to algebraically manipulate the expression into a standard arithmetric-geometric series of the form $\sum k \cdot r^k$. 
After achieving this form, the sum can be evaluated by applying a known identity, which is typicall derived from the derivative of a finite geometric series.
