## Division 1 (Majors in Mathematics & Related Fields)

**Problem 1.**
For the following matrix $A$, find the real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$ holds. (Here, $I$ is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix).

$$
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 1 \\
    -1 & 0 & 1 \\
    -1 & -1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Solution Strategy:**
The goal is to simplify the high-degree matrix polynomial $A^5$ into a linear combination of $A^2$, $A$, and $I$. 
The most direct method is to use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem][Cayley-Hamilton theorem], which states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. 
This will provide a low-degree polynomial relation that can be used to recursively reduce the power of $A^5$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. *Find the Characteristic Equation:* We compute the characteristic equation, $\det \qty(A - \lambda I) = 0$.
    
    $$
      \det \begin{pmatrix}
        -\lambda & 1 & 1 \\
        -1 & -\lambda & 1 \\
        -1 & -1 & -\lambda
      \end{pmatrix} = 0
    $$
    
    Expanding the determinant gives $\lambda^3 + 3\lambda = 0$. 

2. *Apply the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem:*
    The theorem states that matrix $A$ must satisfy its own characteristic equation.
    By substituting $A$ for $\lambda$, we get $A^3 + 3\lambda = O$, where $O$ is the zero matrix.
    This gives us the relation $A^3 = -3A$.

3. *Reduce the Power of $A^5$:*
    We use the relation from Step 2 to simplify $A^5$:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      A^5 &= A^2 \cdot A^3 = A^2 \cdot \qty(-3A) = -3A^3 = -3\qty(-3A) = 9A
    \end{aligned}
    $$

4. *Conclusion:*
    We are given the equation $A^5 = aA^2 + bA + cI$.
    By compairing the coefficients, we find $a = 0$, $b = 9$, and $c = 0$. 

**Problem 2.**
In $3$-dimensional coordinate space, let $S$ be the surface given by the equation $4z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1$.

**Problem 7.** 
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a finite, closed, convex region in the $2$-dimensional coordinate plane, and let its boundary $\beta$ satisfy the following conditions:
  
(1) $\beta$ is a smooth, simple closed curve.  
(2) For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the circle of radius $1$ centered at $O$ intersects $\beta$ at exactly two points.  
(3) For any point $O$ on $\beta$, the tangent line drawn at $O$ does not intersect $\beta$ at any other point besides $O$.  
  
Let $M$ be the midpoint of a rod $PQ$ of length $1$.
As the rod is moved such that its endpoints $P$ and $Q$ always lie on $\beta$ for one full revolution (i.e., $P$ and $Q$ move continuously along $\beta$ for one lap), the locus of $M$ forms a simple closed curve, which we call $\gamma$.
Show that the area of the region between the curves $\beta$ and $\gamma$ is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
